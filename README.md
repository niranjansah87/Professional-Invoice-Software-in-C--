# Professional Invoice Software in C++
 Project Overview: You are required to design and implement a professional invoice system for shops using C++ programming language that incorporates fundamental object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, classes, and objects.  
This invoicing software is designed to help businesses manage their sales, produce invoices, and keep track of their customers and products. File handling should also be included in the system for data storage and retrieval.
This project aims to assess your ability to apply OOP principles in real-world software development. It also assesses your knowledge of file handling fundamentals, best practices in C++, and the general quality, clarity, and documentation of your code.


Project Requirements:
1.User Interface (20 points):
Implement a user-friendly, menu driven console-based user interface in C++ that allows users for tasks such as creating invoices, managing customers, and handling products etc.

2.Inheritance (10 points):
Utilize inheritance to establish a hierarchy of classes for different types of products. For example, you could have a base Product class with derived classes like Electronics, Clothing, and Groceries.

3.Polymorphism (5 points):
Implement polymorphism to allow for the dynamic selection of product types when adding items to an invoice. For example, different products may have unique pricing calculations.

4.Encapsulation (5 points):
Provide proper encapsulation of data within classes, making data members private and providing public methods for accessing and modifying them.

5.Classes and Objects (10 points):
Design and implement necessary classes for the system, such as Product, Customer, and Invoice. 

6.File Handling (10 points):
Use file handling to store and retrieve customer and product information.

7.Billing and Invoicing (10 points):
 Enable users to create new invoices, add products to invoices, and calculate the total bill amount.

8. Documentation (10 points):
   	Provide documentation for the code, including class descriptions, function descriptions and examples of usage.

9. Creativity (20 points):
